# M4_Minima_Test_Code_Fast-PWM_SPI_IRQ_ADC_DAC_SCI

RA4M1 demo code for the Arduino UNO R4 Minima with Fast-PIN, Fast-PWM, SPI, IRQ, ADC, DAC, and SCI operations

This is an example of using bare-metal direct register operations to control the RA4M1 peripherals.
Includes repurposing interrupts, 32-bit SPI1 master and SPI0 slave transfers, etc.
This code is a framework to get started with, it is not a complete application.
